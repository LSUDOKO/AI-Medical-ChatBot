Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads, which are small bumps on the skin. These bumps can range from small, non-inflammatory lesions that are only visible under magnification and are not particularly noticeable to others, to much larger, inflammatory pimples that are visible to the naked eye and often leave scars.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Voice\143e59dff91c8e535219\Temp.mp3,2025-03-18 20:43:55.169440
